Typos and errors in the book:


Eq. 4.41 "++" should be "+"  : fixed

Addeed indices "4DVar!strong constraint", 4DVar!weak constraint", "variational methods", "Euler-Lagrange equations", "En4DVar".

Sec. 9.3 "Fokker-Plank" should be "Fokker-Planck" : fixed

In Approximation 5: The reference to Eq. (6.1) should be Eq. (3.11).

Eq 6.33 and 6.38 and once in the text: error in placement of ^a on C^a_{zz}: fixed in definition of \Czza in extras.tex

Eq. 6.22:  Added definition of Hessian as Del Del J =

Eqs. 6.29 and 6.22: wrong font on transpose superscript ^T -> ^\rmT

Eq. 6.30: Changed constant to \textrm{constant}

Eq. 6.31: \calJ (\bmz^\rma)  -> \calJ (\bmz)

After Eq. 8.25: superscript i on \bmOmega

Algorithm 7 lines 2-4: input D_l inside loop over assimilation windows.
Algorithm 8 lines 2-4: input d and C_dd inside loop over assimilation windows.
Algorithm 8 line 5: Loop over MDA steps
Algorithm 8 line 19: It should be Z=X_K
All algorithms should use a comma and not a colon in for loops, e.g., for i=1,N. Applies to Algorithms 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Eq 8.52 and around  ^+ changed to ^\dagger

Sec 13.5 (sixt line) ^+ changed to ^\dagger
